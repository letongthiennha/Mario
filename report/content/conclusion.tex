\section{Conclusion}
The project successfully delivers a visual data structure learning tool built with C++ and raylib. It demonstrates modular programming, interactive animation, and effective state management. The recently added step-by-step mode enhances the educational value by allowing users to follow each algorithmic operation in detail.

Potential improvements include smoother and clearer animations, the addition of sound effects and background music for engagement, support for more advanced data structures, better control flow handling, and a customizable settings panel that allows users to adjust animation speed, themes, and interaction preferences.
